# DRAMATIS - A Shakespeare Content Browser

I've run the site [ShakespeareGeek](https://www.shakespearegeek.com) for a long time, and am 
always looking for ways to improve it. For twenty years it's provided a personal playground
for me to learn and try new things, and see their immediate impact on my users. 

I got the idea of using AI to add a large number of pages (about a thousand) to the site,
optimized for SEO. More pages equals more Google traffic, which means more people learning
about my site (and, sure, clicking ads and buying merchandise, who are we kidding).

I also wanted to learn React, and TailwindCSS to go along with it. I probably should have done it in Typescript just to nail the trifecta, but I can only handle so much at once.

## And here we have it! 

[The Characters and Plays of William Shakespeare](https://www.shakespearegeek.com/shakespeare_plays)

With this app you can get a summary of each play, as well as a page or so on the individual characters within each play. Though it's all AI-generated, part of having an audience of Shakespeare geeks is that we care and pay attention to this stuff, so the files are regulary updated with bugfixes.

There's nothing proprietary here, so I don't mind making the repository
public. If anybody really wanted it they could just scrape my site, anyway. If nothing else it hopefully demonstrates that I know something about how to code, and not just Shakespeare. It also helps me practice my git-fu.

## Installation

*TBD*

I don't want to write them down incorrectly so I'm not going to write them down at all until I can test what I write.

I will say that the app has some credentials required (Google ads and analytics) so it relies on a .env file. This also affords me the flexibility of not hardcoding a million links to my site. If somebody wanted to host this on their own site it wouldn't be that hard. Although the plays do have hardcoded links back to my site and my merchandise store in a few places that can be easily snipped if you didn't want them.

## Contact

I'm mostly putting this up as a self-learning exercise, as I mentioned, so I have no idea if anybody will ever even see this. If you do, feel free to [contact me](mailto:duane@shakespearegeek.com) with any questions or feedback. I love nothing more than talking about Shakespeare and software.
